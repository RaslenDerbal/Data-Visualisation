# Data-Visualisation# 
#
#
# Here is the README of my Rattrapage in Data Visualisation
# With a dataset obtained from https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/parcelles-en-agriculture-biologique-ab-declarees-a-la-pac/
#
# The librairies to install can be found in requirements.txt.
#
# To have the good format as csv I analysed the data and transformed it to have a proper table as a csv file.
# I decided to create a pie chart and a bar chart to visualise the data as you can see in the python code.
